## Goal

1. To provide a manual, which helps you to obtain or transmit information freely, private and anonymous as possible
2. Describe a general proof of concept or white paper, explaining which developments should be taken to achieve this goal world wide

## Definitions

* Freedom of Information = <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information>
* Privacy = <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy>
* Or more specific internet privacy = <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy>
* Anonymity = <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity>

## Simplified threat model

Concerning loss of anonymity:

* People know what you read ... and think
* Browser finger printing
* Location detection and finger printing by Internet Protocol
* Finger printing by hardware leakage

Concerning information: there is only one threat! Not enough independent, unbiased information sources.

## Basic security concept

The basic security concept is based on the [blog post](https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.ca/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html) by the following three aspects:

1. Security by Correctness
2. Security by Isolation
3. Security by Obscurity

for every layer of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). These three rsecurity aspects should of course also be applied to hardware and software of the used the communication devices.

## Initial counter measures

Concerning anonymity:

* Make sure people cannot snope your data, use [HTTPS:// EVERYWHERE](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).
* Disabling browser features which leak fingerprints. Good solution is [Torbrowser Bundle (TBB)](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en).
* Using either Onion ([Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)) or Garlic ([I2P](https://geti2p.net/)) routing to prevent location detection.
	- Appearantly, there are some other alternatives: [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/) and [GNUnet](https://gnunet.org/)
* Use both routing protocols with [Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org/)
* Harderning and isolation concerning communcation [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/)
* Harderning and isolation within operating system [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
* Use "open source" hardware of e.g. [Minifree/ Gluglug](https://minifree.org/), [Purism](https://puri.sm/) or perhaps the Chromebook, unfortunately some of them are too expensive for standards PC user. Perhaps, the hardware kill switches need some redesign.

Concerning information: check out the following websites:

* [The Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

## Verification/ PDCA

Of course software should be made available to verify, that the above mentioned criteria are held upright in the sense of [Plan, Do, Check, Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).

* Check if you are using https
* Checking your browser: [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) or [JonDonym test](http://ip-check.info/?lang=en)
* Check if you are using Tor: [Check Torproject](https://check.torproject.org/)

## Getting used to

An initial introduction of improving your freedoms and anonymity is using:

* [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) on a bootable CD-ROM or USB flash device.

## This website

* [i2p](http://fifi4all.i2p/) or as [Address helper](http://fifi4all.i2p/?i2paddresshelper=v6h4zUKLDDwvpOkkkDZ9ph7Ff1-djSNwD8Yu3xD8JVVfQvIaBEpk9YUhGYIVvhLVRi158sqAErKrkSJuPpQMvehaspY17ckuorRxSnEoQ8I3IeEmyriF2cUIfrDZjXm4xb24GjwtUTMN-bccQa7UhduS-cHhD0~ml3at4GRrPlCQW8u5Kb7I7etEWg3pvQbBsHe9T7VEh9LG29xlCabTIY7q4MTkwGHTMTSlzhU4pfe2PDMqGhfOFFmXkn4A7QZgSmQrNY~jO3necc22bwNagB5dOXAyJHYZV4tNEOio7PIIekzmoCdLMoxrya6lCTTLf6Z7isS8NjzoxHOjGxT7nyvfMIHbTDORHsUg-BGUKAjE9Cjvzc1TjHvxy5O0pDhdLFPV6yjP8uDHz5hAe9M6ZTHFY4Sj97-EN2yT7VVKp-DCcUn9~UWBnPBf19Qly5KPeDmkh9kvqjSdhFbF-wn9ZoiaCEZgbC0mKHAcdTCl5hogj7309A2Eg2o3Usc305ARBQAEAAEAAA==)
