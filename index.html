    <h1>Freedom of Information by access over a Free Internet for All</h1>
    <p>FiFi = (Fi)re (Fi)ghting, which is need to protect our</p>
    <p>FiFi4All.i2p = (F)reedom of (I)nformation by access over a (F)ree (I)nternet for All</p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To provide a manual, which helps you to obtain or transmit information freely, private and anonymous as possible</li>
      <li>Describe a general proof of concept or white paper, explaining which developments should be taken to achieve this goal world wide</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Freedom of Information = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information</a></li>
      <li>Privacy = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy</a></li>
      <li>Or more specific internet privacy =  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy</a></li>
      <li>Anonymity = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Simplified threat model</h2>
    Concerning loss of anonymity:
    <ul>
      <li>People know what you read ... and think</li>
      <li>Browser finger printing</li>
      <li>Location detection and finger printing by Internet Protocol</li>
      <li>Finger printing by hardware leakage</li>
    </ul>
    Concerning information: there is only one threat! Not enough independent, unbiased information sources.    
    <h2>Basic security concept</h2>
    The basic security concept is based on the <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.ca/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html">blog post</a> by the following three aspects:
    <ol>
      <li>Security by Correctness</li>
      <li>Security by Isolation</li>
      <li>Security by Obscurity</li>
    </ol>
    for every layer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a>. These three rsecurity aspects should of course also be applied to hardware and software of the used the communication devices.
    <h2>Initial counter measures</h2>
    Concerning anonymity:
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure people cannot snope your data, use <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS:// EVERYWHERE</a>. </li>
      <li>Disabling browser features which leak fingerprints. Good solution is <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Torbrowser Bundle (TBB)</a>. </li>
      <li>Using either Onion (<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>) or Garlic (<a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a>) routing to prevent location detection.</li>
      <li>Use both routing protocols with <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a></li>
      <li>Harderning and isolation concerning communcation <a href="https://www.whonix.org/">Whonix</a></li>
      <li>Harderning and isolation within operating system <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a></li>
      <li>Use "open source" hardware of e.g. <a href="https://minifree.org/">Minifree/ Gluglug</a>, <a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> or perhaps the Chromebook, unfortunately some of them are too expensive for standards PC user. Perhaps, the hardware kill switches need some redesign.</li>
    </ul>
    Concerning information: check out the following websites:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/">The Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Verification/ PDCA</h2>
    Of course software should be made available to verify, that the above mentioned criteria are held upright in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">Plan, Do, Check, Act</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Check if you are using https</li>
      <li>Checking your browser: <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> or <a href="http://ip-check.info/?lang=en">JonDonym test</a></li>
      <li>Check if you are using Tor: <a href="https://check.torproject.org/">Check Torproject</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting used to</h2>
    An initial introduction of improving your freedoms and anonymity is using:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> on a bootable CD-ROM or USB flash device.
    </ul>
    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    Make this information public not only on I2P, but also on Github and git.repo.i2p.
